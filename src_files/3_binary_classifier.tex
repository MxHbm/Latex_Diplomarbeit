\chapter{Binary Classifier}
\label{chap:classifier}

A practical application of the \gls{CLP} is the integration in the \gls{VRP}, where
a number of customers need to be served with a set of items by a fleet of vehicles that have
to start from a depot and return. The goal is to minimize the total distance driven
by the vehicles. When considering multidimensional items, the NP-hard problem itself,
increases in complexity, as every tour is representing a \gls{CLP} itself. \footcite[cf.][pp. 1--2]{tamke_branch-and-cut_2024}
The packing of each route is either feasible or infeasible due to the loading constraints,
opening the possibility for classifiers to predict to loading status of each tour.
These classifiers are supervised learning models, which are trained on a labeled dataset,
where the correct output values are known in advance, and then use this knowledge to
make predictions on new, unseen data. The accuracy can be evaluated afterwards by comparing
the predicted labels with the actual labels. \footcite[cf.][]{kotsiantis_supervised_2007}
An exemplary train dataset is shown in Table~\ref{tab:classifier_label_data}.

\input{tables/label_classifier}

A classifier can be trained using various \gls{ML} models such as \gls{LR},
\gls{ANN}, support vector machines, or others. However, the most crucial aspect of any
\gls{ML} model is the selection of data, particularly the choice of features and
the size of the training set, since many models can be implemented from available
libraries and be compared performance wise. The model attempts to learn correlations between the provided features
and the corresponding labels. If the features are poorly chosen, the model may fail
to capture the underlying patterns in the data. Additionally, if the training set
is too small, the model might not generalize well, ultimately lacking the ability
to accurately predict unseen data. Furthermore, it needs to be noted, that available
\gls{ML} models are not by nature superior to other models, but can significantly outperform
other models on specific application problem \footcite[cf.][pp. 250, 264]{kotsiantis_supervised_2007}.


\section{Evaluation metrics for ML approaches}
\label{sec:classifier_objectives}
To compare different models and \gls{ML} approaches performance indicators are needed. The most
measures rely on the binary output of the confusion matrix, which sorts the output along
their true and predicted labels. The goal is to minimize the false predicted values.
\begin{comment}
The predicted labels of the \gls{ML} model are
divided in two groups via a certain threshold, usually 0.5, with all predicted values above it,
considered in the predictive positive column and below it, in the predicted negative column.
\end{comment}

\begin{table}[ht]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{@{}lcc@{}}
        \toprule
                                 & \textbf{Predicted Positive} & \textbf{Predicted Negative} \\
        \midrule
        \textbf{Actual Positive} & \Gls{TP}                    & \Gls{FN}                    \\
        \textbf{Actual Negative} & \Gls{FP}                    & \Gls{TN}                    \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Confusion matrix (binary classification).}
    \label{tab:confusion_matrix}
\end{table}

The dispersion of the single groups can be used to calculate the accuracy and the F1-score of the classification,
which are standard performance metrics assessing the model between 0 (worst) and 1 (best) characteristic:
\begin{align}
    \text{Accuracy}=\frac{TP+TN}{TP+FN+TN+FP}
    \qquad
    \text{F1}=\frac{2\,TP}{2\,TP+FP+FN}
\end{align}
The accuracy is the ratio between the true classified classes against the whole population
of predictions. The F1-score emphasis the \gls{TP} labels and is therefore especially
often used for classification purposes.
However, these evaluation metrics draw too optimistic a picture of the model performance,
when the dataset is imbalanced. Imbalance is occurrent,
when the classes representing each label, feasible and infeasible, have a huge size difference.\footcite[cf.][p.2f.]{chicco_advantages_2020}
Two alternative metrics are firstly the \gls{MCC}, which is robust against imbalance
and focuses on \gls{FP} and \gls{FN} values. \gls{MCC} has the advantage to account the majority of the predictions
relative to class size and is defined from -1 to 1. \footcite[cf.][p.5]{chicco_advantages_2020}
\begin{align}
    \text{MCC}=\frac{TP*TN - FP*FN}{\sqrt{(TP+FP)*(TP+FN)*(TN+FP)*(TN+FN)}}
\end{align}
Secondly, the \gls{AUROC},where several thresholds are used
to calculate the \gls{TPR} and the \gls{FPR} for different acceptance steps,
which indicates how well the classification does in general terms. \footcite[cf.][p.2f.]{chicco_advantages_2020}
\begin{align}
    \text{TPR}=\frac{TP}{TP+FN}
    \qquad
    \text{FPR}=\frac{TN}{FP+TN}
\end{align}
The following Plot~\ref{fig:AUROC_curve} shows several receiver operating curves and their corresponding \gls{AUROC} values, also shown
in the legend. The baseline is the angle bisector indicating random guessing with an \gls{AUROC} value of 0.5. The fit gets better
for an increasing area under the curve. The perfect fit is displayed, when the full square is covered under the receiver operating curve.

\input{Plots/auroc_plot.tex}

To highlight the differences between an imbalanced and balances training dataset, two classifications and their respective
evaluation metrics with exception of the \gls{AUROC} are compared.

    \label{tab:indicator_comparison}
\end{table}
In these two examples weaknesses of classical evaluation metrics are apparent. In the first
example the positive and negative label classes are equal, and the distribution for the
labels is more or less random, as the sum of the false predicted values is almost equal to
the true predicted values. The accuracy and the \gls{MCC} indicate this random guessing
behavior with values close to the middle of the respective indicator range.
The accuracy is slightly positive as the rate of true predicted values of the positive class
with $94\%$ is very high. As the dataset is balanced classic metrics can still grasp
the poor performance of the classifier. However, when looking at the second example, both
accuracy and F1-score have very high values indicating very good performance, but this is
due to the imbalanced class distribution. In the negative class with 9 samples, only $11\%$
are correctly classified, this poor performance is shown with a low \gls{MCC} score. It needs
to be noted, that in every example it needs to be chosen, where the optimization focus should
be laid to, if only the \gls{TPR} is from interest F1-score serves well.\footcite[cf.][p.8f.]{chicco_advantages_2020}
The next section will dive deeper how the routes for the training data are retrieved.


\section{Data Retrieval}
\label{sec:DataRetrieval}
Collecting the training data is one crucial step, for the model creation and two approaches exist.

\subsubsection{Saving labeled routes from exact algorithms (Save strategy)}
The first one is to save all routes with exact loading label from an exisiting \gls{3L-CVRP}
algorithm, as \cite{zhang_learning-based_2022} did in their paper. However the binary classifier
was integrated in the same exact algorithm
and therefore the solution structure of routes in the train data is similar to the real data afterwards. \footcite[cf.][]{zhang_learning-based_2022}
To follow this approach the exact branch-and-cut algorithm from \cite{tamke_branch-and-cut_2024} was
used to save all routes, which are labeled and found in an 8-hour timelimit from an instance. The routes
are saved based on their respective \gls{LoadSt} and \gls{LoadFl}. The \gls{LoadSt} sorts the routes in the
label categories feasible, infeasible and unknown and is determined by the exact \gls{CP} solver.
If the solver could not find a deterministic feasible/ infeasible label in the timelimit fot the solver the route
will be classified as unknown, based on the resp. \gls{LoadFl}.
The \gls{LoadFl} defines the subset of
loading constraints used. Three \glspl{LoadFl} are considered in the orginal algorithm, which are shown
in the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item All Constraints: $\mathcal{G}$
    \item No Support Area: $\mathcal{G}\setminus \{\text{SupportArea}\}$
    \item No Sequence: $\mathcal{G}\setminus \{\text{Sequence}\}$
\end{itemize}
During the algorithm labeled routes are saved based on these two categories. The concrete route sequence
is only relevant for the first two \glspl{LoadFl}, and the routes are saved as sequences. For the third
group \textit{No Sequence} the found routes are independent from their sequence and a respective set
of the customer ids without a order is saved. \footcites[Retrieved from][]{tamke_repository_2024}[cf.][]{tamke_branch-and-cut_2024}
After the branch-and-cut algorithme the routes are sorted into different sets composed of the \gls{LoadFl} and \gls{LoadSt}.
All the route sequences found are resepcted for the train dataset. However, as the permutation number of all combinations
of customer ids of the sets from the third \gls{LoadFl} \textit{No Sequence}, would dominate the train dataset number wise,
three random permutations are considered from each set. The following table highlights, which routes depending on the
\gls{LoadFl} and \gls{LoadSt} are considered for the final train dataset.

\begin{table}[ht]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{@{}
            P{0.20\textwidth} % AllConstraints
            P{0.20\textwidth} % NoSupport
            P{0.20\textwidth} % NoLIFO
            @{}}
        \toprule
        \textbf{All Constraints}     & \textbf{NoSupport}           & \textbf{NoLIFO}              \\
        \midrule
        \cellcolor{green!20}Feasible & Feasible                     & Feasible                     \\
        \cellcolor{red!20}Infeasible & \cellcolor{red!20}Infeasible & \cellcolor{red!20}Infeasible \\
        \cellcolor{red!20}Unknown    & \cellcolor{red!20}Unknown    & \cellcolor{red!20}Unknown    \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Construction of training data from branch-and-cut routes. All green cells are labeled as feasible, and all
        red cells as infeasible data}
    \label{tab:train_data_BC_routes}
\end{table}

As the trained classifier is used in an algorithm considering all loading constraints, feasible tours
must fulfill all loading constraints, but infeasible tours from a subset of loading constraints
will also be infeasible, when more loading constraints are considered.\footcite[cf.][p.7]{tamke_branch-and-cut_2024} Therefore
the distinction is made in Table~\ref{tab:train_data_BC_routes}.
As the same tour can occur in different infeasible / unknown sets
duplicated tours will be deleted before training the model. To distinguish this strategy, it will
be called \textit{Save Strategy}.

\subsubsection{Creating random routes (Random Strategy)}
An alternative to the first approach is to create random routes from the \gls{3L-CVRP} instances used.
These routes need to be labeled in feasible and infeasible routes regarding their loading.
A \gls{CLP} algorithm with high solution quality is needed to ensure the correct labels. As the heuristic approaches
presented in Section~\ref{sec:classical_solution_approaches} do not provide an optimal solution,
the best choice is to use an exact approach to determine if all items fit into the container considering the loading constraints.
For this purpose, the exact \gls{CP} model was extracted from \cite{tamke_repository_2024} to create
a standalone \gls{CLP} solver, which can be called for just one route.\footcite[Stolen with permission from][]{tamke_repository_2024}
The random routes are created with the Algorithm~\ref{fig:flowchart_randomRouteGeneration}, and four parameters are introduced to
control the number of random routes found and their characteristics. As the pseudocode has a lot of details, the parameters and
functionalities are summarized in the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item 4 Input Parameters
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Multiplier $\alpha$: Integer determining repetitions ($n\times\alpha$) for each route length $n$
              \item  Attempts limit $\beta$: Integer determining max failures per repetition
              \item  Success threshold $\gamma$: Integer determining success threshold per repetition
              \item  Lower threshold $\delta$: Float determining the range [$\delta$,1] to draw relative volume and weight capacity thresholds for one route
              \item Instance set $\mathcal{I}$: Set of instances routes should be generated from
          \end{itemize}
    \item Route length is starting with two customers increasing until no routes can be found
    \item Duplicates are discarded by checking every new route against a route
    \item Algorithm stops when no random route could be drawn in $n \times \alpha$ rounds
\end{itemize}

Generally the higher the parameters $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$ are set and the more instances
are considered in the instance set $\mathcal{I}$, the more routes will be found. When the threshold $\delta$
is chosen smaller than 1, then shorter and fewer routes are selected. Different
random training datasets are presented in the Chapter~\ref{chap:computational_study}.
This strategy will be called \textit{Random Strategy}. In the nexr section three model candidates
are presented more in detail.

\section{Model Selection}
\label{sec:modelselection}
Every supervised learning method can predict the feasibility of a single loading, and the comparison
between different models is a tidious job. Therefore only three different classification
models will be explained in detail and compared in the computational study.
Two different types of models will be compared, regression and pure classification models. Regression
models are based on calculations and output a value between 0 and 1, which is then classified with
an artifical threshold in two distinct classes, as feasible and infeasible loading. Pure classification
models predict directly the label. \footcite[cf.][p.5]{nasteski_overview_2017}

\subsubsection{Logistic Regression}

The idea for \gls{LR} is based on linear regression, where either one or multiple independent explanatory
variables $\beta_i$ are multiplied with the feature values $X_i$ to sum up to a continuous scalar $\pi_i$.
The resulting model is the linear equation of the y-axis interception $\beta_0$
and the gradient variables $\beta_i$.
These explanatory variables are fitted to the population of samples by minimizing the mean squared
error. Afterwards the model can be used to predict new data points.\footcite[cf.][pp. 6-7]{nasteski_overview_2017}
The linear regression formula is depicted in the following, indicating the usage of vectors with bold font.
\begin{align}
    \pi_i=\beta_0+\beta_0*X_i+\dots+\beta_n*X_n = \beta_0 + \bm{\beta} * \bm{X}
    \label{eq:base_lr}
\end{align}
Linear regression is a very simple modeling approach and serves as a benchmark for many problems. As the Formula~\ref{eq:base_lr} is able to predict continuous
values, it is not possible to classify binary values. Therefore the output variable $\pi_i$ is transformed via a logistic function, called sigmoid function,
to model a continuous probability distribution with the formula:
\begin{align}
    \sigma(z)=\frac{1}{1+\exp^{-z}},\, \text{with } z = \beta_0 + \bm{\beta} * \bm{X}
    \label{eq:logistic_func}
\end{align}
The resulting logistic function is bound to the range of 0 and 1, and results can be interpreted
in two labels using an threshold. An output of 0.5 can be interpreted as random
guessing between both labels, as $z=0$. The curve of the logistic function is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:LR_plot}.
The model is fitted to predict feasible and infeasible loadings best.\footcite[cf.][]{kirasich_random_2018}

\input{Plots/logistic_regression_sigmoid.tex}

\subsubsection{Decision Trees}
Decision trees classify samples by sorting them based on their features. Every decision tree
is built up by three elements, one root node and several branches and leaves. The root node
depicts the starting point of the classification and is a branch, classifying the sample
regarding to one feature. At every level of the tree several branches are added, which can be followed
by either branches or leafes. Each branch splits the instance space into two or more sub-spaces
according to a certain threshold of the input values. A leaf is the exit point declaring
the label of the sample data.\footcite[cf.][p.5-6]{nasteski_overview_2017}
The following small decision tree (see Fig.~\ref{fig:decision_tree}) is an example,
how the loading could be classified with numerical features.

\input{tikz/decision_tree.tex}
The  prominent advantage is, that the logic behind the classification can be understood
completely. In this example all routes, with more than 30 items and $70\%$ volume utilization are classified infeasible,
as well as those tours where the relative weight utilization is above $80\%$, but the volume utilization is lower. The complex
$NP$-hard problem is to find the optimal binary decision tree and finding the optimal subset and order of
features.
When many levels of branches are added, and the decision tree grows in depth, the chance of
overfitting the decision tree to the training data is more likely. Therefore several control mechanisms
were developed to avoid this. The first one is to control the maximum depth (\textit{max\_depth})
of the decision tree. Secondly, after the decision tree is created, to prune it by removing leaves from
the tree and comparing it with an identical descision tree, if this has lowered the overall performance
and the third method is stopping the fitting algorithm before the data is perfectly fitted to. \footcite[cf.][p.252]{kotsiantis_supervised_2007}
One further advantage of decision trees is that the data does not need to to be scaled as every feature is
tested on feature own thresholds, in comparion of the other presented models.

\subsubsection{Feed Forward Neural Networks}

Neural networks are a collection of single perceptrons/ neuron, which are all internally connected and
,in the case of feed forward networks, signals are only allowed to go straight from input to output. One neuron
in the network is either defined as input, output or as hidden unit. One neuron calculates its
output similar to the \gls{LR} with $X_i$ feature values and $w_i$ weights, the output is defined
as $\sum_{i \in \mathcal{n}} X_i * w_i$ and can be truncated by a threshold forcing all about above 1
to be 1 and all negative values to be zero. Every unit signals its output calculated by an individual
activation function to all the next units of the next layer of the network. All the signals are
then interpreted at the output layer. For binary classification tasks the presented sigmoid function from \gls{LR} is used.
An exemplary neural network is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ffnn}.\footcite[cf.][p.255]{kotsiantis_supervised_2007}

\input{tikz/feed_forward_model.tex}

The training of the single layers and deciding which layers should be used is a complex task
and modern libraries as PyTorch are supporting with prebuilt models and analysis functions to choose
a good setup. Generally a \gls{FFNN} can be considered as an advanced \gls{LR} model,
which allows also nonlinear functions to be used for the processing of signals.

\parbreak
\cite{kotsiantis_supervised_2007} states, that no supervised \gls{ML} method is superior to another,
but each has its own advantages and disadavantages, which need to be considered.
Therefore all three different types are included in this work to compare performances, and
to understand the complexity of the underlying classification problem. As \gls{FFNN} normally
tend to need a large sample size and perform good with continuous data and  decision trees can be
trained on much smaller samples and perform good with mixed datatypes consisting of discrete/binary
and continuous values.\footcite[cf.][pp. 262ff.]{kotsiantis_supervised_2007}
\gls{LR} is a standard method and the easiest to implement and to train, and can dominate
other approaches due to their simplicity and interoperability. \footcite[cf.][p.8]{kirasich_random_2018}
In the following section the features used for training the single models are presented.
In Chapter~\ref{chap:computational_study} the performance of the single models is compared.

\section{Model Training}
\label{sec:ModelTraining}

Training is based on which model selected, XGBoost or /gls{FFNN} from pytorch library or others. Afterwards the Mini batch descent

\end{comment}

\section{Features}
\label{sec:Features}

Features are the most important puzzle piece for training a \gls{ML} model, as they portray the reality in numerical values, trying to
reduce the complexity without the loss of meaningfulness. In the presented case the loading feasibility probability of single tours.
The complete feature list spans 48 features, which can be divided in three groups to understand the underlying logic.

\begin{itemize}
    \item 2 General Features: General information about each tour
    \item 10 Loading Constraint Features: Concepted to depict the loading constraint set $\mathcal{G}$
    \item 36 Geometrical Ratio Features: Contain several geometrical ratio of items and container size
\end{itemize}

Some additional definitions to Section~\ref{sec:mathematical_formulation}
are necessary to define the features formally. Following the mathematical definition, every route consists of the customers
from the subset $S \subseteq C$. Items of the set of item types $M$ is requested in different quantities by all customers $C$.
Each item type $m_j$ has its own dimensions height $z_j$, length $x_j$, width $y_j$, weight $q_j$ and fragility flag $f_j$.
The loading flag contains binary values of either 0 (nonfragile) or 1 (fragile).
Each customer $i$ demands $d_{ij}$ units of item type $j$.
The total weight, volume and quantity requested by a customer $i$ or the whole subset $S$ is calculated then by:

\[q(i) = \sum_{j \in M} q_j * d_{ij}\;\text{, resp. } q(S) = \sum_{i\in S} q(i)\]
\[v(i) = \sum_{j \in M} v_j * d_{ij}\;\text{, resp. } v(S) = \sum_{i\in S} v(i)\]
\[d(i) = \sum_{j \in M} d_{ij}\;\text{, resp. } D(S) = \sum_{i\in S} d(i)\]

Furthermore it is necessary to define the homogeneous fleet of vehicles
further. Every vehicle $k$ has the same dimensions of height $z_k$, length $x_k$ and width $y_k$ resulting in the maximum volume limit per
vehicle $Q = x_k *y_k*z_k$. As all vehicles are identical, the indices are obsolent, but are kept to distinguish clearer
from the item properties.

\subsubsection{General Features}
These two feature contain the number of customers $|S|$ in the respective route without the depot, and the total number of items requested by
this subset of customers $D(S)$.

\subsubsection{Loading Constraint Features}

The constraints are given in the Table~\ref{tab:loading_constraints_features} with the formula calculating the feature as well as the set of
loading constraints this feature is belonging to. The distinction, which loading constraints are described by which feature, is not
unambiguously, as several features can be adressed. The range of values is given in the last column with $h$ representing any number in $\mathbb{N}^{+}$.
All of the features presented have only values relative to the instance specific dimensions and weight limit of the vehicle, as these values
differ between different datasets, but also within the \gendreauDataSetText dataset. \footcite[cf.][p. 346]{gendreau_tabu_2006}
Capuring the \gls{LIFO} constraint is the most challenging task as multidimensionality and order is complex to be describe numerically
with one value. Therefore certain customer specific values, as relative volume/ weight or the share of fragile items, is multiplied
with the order in which the customers are driven to. \textit{Fragile Sequence} depicts the difficulty to load fragile items
in the beginning as further items need to be likely placed upon the first items.

\subsubsection{Geometrical Ratio Features}
The third and last feature group
was partly used by \cite{zhang_learning-based_2022} and is expanded for additional geometrical ratios applicable to three-dimensional loading.\footcite[cf.][p. 14]{zhang_learning-based_2022}
All geometrical ratios express the relation between two geometrical properties of either one item or one item to the vehicle. These ratios
are calculated for each item demanded from $S$ and afterwards the minimum, maximum, mean and standard deviation is calculated
from the $D(S)$ ratios, which are used as features. These ratios are expressed visually in the following Figure~\ref{fig:geometrical_ratio_features}.

\end{figure}

All these nine geometrical features grasp the geometrical description of all items and is further outlined in the following example:
When we consider a route, where these three items are requested, described by their geometrical dimensions \{height, length, width\}:
\[
    \mathcal{I} = \{(12,5,10),\,(10,3,6),\,(10,10,10)\}
\]

\[
    \text{Width--Length Ratios: }
    \frac{y_j}{x_j} = \{2,\,2,\,1\}
\]

\[
    \begin{array}{c|c|c|c}
        \text{Min} & \text{Max} & \text{Mean} & \text{Std. Dev.} \\
        \hline
        1          & 2          & 1.67        & 0.471            \\
    \end{array}
\]

For every geometrical ratio the four features are calculated with this approach and are added to the model.

The complete name list of the 48 features is shown in the appendix in Table~\ref{tab:complete_features_list}. The next section
presents methods how to select a subset of features.

\section{Feature Selection}
\label{sec:feature_engineering}

The selection of a subset of features helps to simplify the model by increasing the interpretability and the computation time
for the features. Furthermore, \gls{ML} model types can be negatively affected by non-informative features, which are not correlated
to the prediction outcome. This applies to all models, where all predicting values are combined in a statistical formula
and are considered in the output value, as \gls{LR} and \gls{FFNN}. However all tree- and rule-based models, as decision trees, are resistant
to the negative influence of non-informative features as not every feature is used for branching. \footcite[cf.][pp. 487-489]{kuhn_applied_2016}
The following Figure~\ref{fig:feature-performance} visualizes how a performance metric, as accuracy, develops depending if the model is
resistant to a high number of non-informative features.
\input{Plots/feature_seletction.tex}

The feature selection approaches for supervised learning models can be divided in three groups, filter, wrapper and embedded methods.
Filter methods are ranking techniques, which are used to select a feature subset before the model is trained, by analyzing
the dependency between the features and the output variables. By defining a threshold or an explicit number of features, the
resulting subset is selected. Mutual correlation between features exists and is not considered by filter methods
leading to redundany. Furthermore, the datatype of $X$ and $Y$ determines which filter method is applicable. The risk
of overfitting is reduced as the selection of features is conducted without respecting the model performance.
Wrapper methods are evaluating the model performance with different subsets of features. As the possible number of combinations is growing
exponentially, choosing the right subset is a $NP$-hard problem. Several heuristic methods are used to tackle this task, among them
are sequential selection algorithms, adding resp. removing one feature after each other,
\glspl{GA} or branch-and-bound algorithms. The main difference to filter methods is the focus on the model performance.
Embedded approaches aim to reduce the computation time needed for the wrapper methods by integrating the
feature selection in the training process. \footcites[cf.][pp.17-21]{chandrashekar_survey_2014} As this thesis will analyse several
different datasets and models, the combinations of dataset model tuples for which a perfect feature subset
has to be selected are numerous. Therefore, the same subset of features will be used for each model and dataset to provide comparability.
An adapted filter method is therefore used with the goal to find a subset of features strongly dependent
to the output label, but with low mutual correlation between the features. The following Figure~\ref{fig:overview_Feature_selection}
gives an overview over the methods and narrows the possible applicable methods.

\input{tikz/overview_feature_selection.tex}

A general approach was published by \cite{hall_feature_1997},
where a joint numerator $G_s$ was constructed of the correlation between the features of the selected group $s$ and to the output variable.
The optimization goal is to find the optimal group $s^*$ maximizing $G_{s^*}$ having high correlation to the output variable and low
correlation among the features in the group $s^*$. The correlation was measured by calculating the conditional entropy, which is independent
from the data type (numerical, ordinal, categorical) of features and output variables. Unfortunately, no heuristic for finding the optimal
feature subset was given. \footcite[cf.][p.856]{hall_feature_1997} Another approach was presented from \cite{haindl_feature_2006},
where features are discarded from the feature set based on the accumulated mutual correlation between features. However, the correlation between
the features and the output variables is not respected and this approach could lead to non-informative features. \footcite[cf.][]{haindl_feature_2006}
To avoid determining the maximum number of features beforehand, which is required for solely applied filter methods,
a own feature selection Algorithm~\ref{alg:filter_algorithm} is presented, which follows the principle of the two previous approaches.
The procedure filters all  high mutually correlated features, with a low dependency score,  as well as all features, which have a
score below a certain quantile threshold $\epsilon$.

\input{algorithms/feature_filter.tex}

The dependency between the output variable $Y$ and the feature data $X$ $\mathcal{R}_{d,\kappa}(\mathcal{F})$ is computed either by the
\gls{MI} or the \gls{F-Score}. Both scores explain the dependency of numerical feature data to a categorical output value (see Fig.~\ref{fig:overview_Feature_selection}),
but have different scales. As \gls{MI} is defined in [0,1] and \gls{F-Score} in $\mathbb{R}_0^+$, the scores are standardized by $\mathcal{N}(0,1)$ to
apply the same thresholds. \gls{MI} is defined as the impact of a feature $X$ to reduce the uncertainty of the output variable $Y$.
The advantage over classical linear correlation techniques is that also nonlinear relations can be mapped.\footcite[cf.][pp.539-539]{battiti_using_1994}
The \gls{F-Score} used is based on the \gls{ANOVA} and computes the linear dependency between the features and the output value.\footcite[cf.][p.2]{gu_generalized_2012}
Both methods are used to distinguish, if linear or non-linear dependencies exists betweenn $X$ and $Y$. The mutual correlation between the variables
is computed with the \textit{Pearson} correlation coefficient applicable to pure numerical data and is computed as following: \footcite[cf.][p.17]{chandrashekar_survey_2014}
\begin{equation}
    \text{Pearson Correlation Coefficient: }C(f,f') = \frac{Covariance(X_f,X_{f'})}{\sqrt{Variance(X_f)\times Variance(X_{f'})}}
\end{equation}
Several different filtered subsets can be obtained for varying the filter method $\kappa$, the correlation thresholds $\Phi$, the boundary $\mathcal{B}$ and
different quantile thresholds $\epsilon$. Adding also a certain threshold for features with a low score has the motivation to trim non-informative features.
The following Figure~\ref{fig:normal_distribution} highlights that all features, which have a scaled importance score below $z_{\epsilon}$ are added to the drop candidates.

\input{Plots/normal_dist.tex}

Different subsets of features are presented in the Chapter~\ref{chap:computational_study}. In the following Chapter~\ref{chap:algorithm}
the used metaheuristic is presented.
